# This exercise (was to be) related to incidence matrix and co-boundary mapping from:
# https://csustan.csustan.edu/~tom/Clustering/GraphLaplacian-tutorial.pdf

# it is a super good .pdf on Incidence Matrix, Co-boundary mapping

# To summarize
# if graph has E edges and V vertices then:
#
# Incidence matrix is ExV with values:
#   -1 if edge is leaving vertex
#   +1 if edge is into vertex
#    0 if edge does not touch vertex

# A vertex "n" has embedded attributes x,x,x, and a function value f_n
# The 

# A co-boundary mapping is a mapping from vertex function values into a set of edge values.
